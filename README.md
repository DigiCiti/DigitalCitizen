# DigitalCitizen
This is the general repository for work on the Digital Citizen project.

Will be adding explanation of project mission, status, objectives, and more to complete this README.

This project will require collaborators to view prototypes/wireframes to begin development.  The wireframe files will be hosted in this repository and info about their status and project plans will follow.

Visit digiciti.org for information about this project.
